				<p>Carpool World has a social media-ish profile setup, where users can set profile pictures, describe their typical routes, and give a description of how flexible they are as a driver. We'd like to emulate that profile setup, with additional sections about their major at Tech, whether they're an undergrad or graduate, and an expanded description of what they're like as a person. Uber also does this more expanded profile management.</p>
