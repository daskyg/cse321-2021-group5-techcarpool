				<p>Carpool World has a social media-ish profile setup, where users can set profile pictures, describe their typical routes, and give a description of how flexible they are as a driver. We'd like to emulate that profile setup, with additional sections about their major at Tech, whether they're an undergrad or graduate, and an expanded description of what they're like as a person. Uber also does this more expanded profile management.</p>

		<h3> Report: Website Analysis </h3>
		<section class="subsection">
		<p>In this report, we take a look at similar websites and decide what features we want to include in our website.
		 After determining the features we'd like in our website, we provide a storyboard for the user experience on desktop
		and mobile sites.

		<h3> Report: Website Content Analysis </h3>
		<section class="subsection">
			<p>In this report, we only take a look at the actual content side of the website, so this section only has to do with our storyboard.
				As such, linked below are separate storyboards for the user experience on desktop and mobile.

		<h3> Report: Database Analysis </h3>
		<section class="subsection">
			<p>This report will take an in depth look at the database design/structure we'll need to implement in order
				to accomplish the functionality we want in our website. Since we're early in the prototyping stage, we have not
				yet completed the database analysis, though this page will be updated once that is complete.
